## Experience
### **Shenzhen Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics for Society (AIRS)**(Dec 2024 --  )
#### *Research Assistant* (Shenzhen, China)
- Working on a novel approach that significantly reduces the dependency on expensive manual data collection by leveraging video-based imitation learning and generative models.
- Contributed to developing a single-cam vision-based teleoperation pipeline using Allegro Hand in both reality and simulator(Sapien), developed a Python interface for the Allegro Hand‚Äôs ROS API using a customized approach.
- Maintained ‚ÄùGrasp What You Want‚Äù(arXiv:2412.10694), a system integrating a VLM that fuses visual information and (Referring Expression Representation Enrichment) RERE-processed natural language commands translated from voice, using Grounding-SAM to segment the target object, performing object feature vector extraction get the PCA axis, with a robust grasp planning and optimization pipeline, specifically designed for dexterous hands.
### **Machine Intelligence and Advanced Adaptation Lab (MIAA) in SCUT**(Sep 2024 -- Dec 2024  )
#### *Research Assistant* (Guangzhou, China)
- Reproduced Rekep using Kinova arm+Realsense d435i+Ubuntu20.04 RTX2080ti.
- Reproduced ReKep (arXiv:2409.01652), a spatio-temporal reasoning framework employing Python functions to map relational 3D keypoints into numerical costs, implementing hierarchical optimization for SE(3) trajectory planning with real-time closed-loop control at 10Hz, leveraging DINOv2 for semantic keypoint proposal and GPT-4o for automated constraint generation from language instructions, with multi-stage task handling and bimanual coordination capabilities in simulator(Isaac Sim) on laptop(Win11 RTX3060laptop) and PC(Ubuntu20.04 RTX2080ti).
### **Festo AG \& Co. KG**(Jul 2024 -- Sep 2024)
#### *Intern Software Engineer* (Shanghai, China)
- Established dual-OS development environment in my personal laptop for vision-guided manipulation system, resolving GPU-kernel compatibility and DL framework dependencies through systematic debugging.
### **National University of Singapore**(Jul 2023 -- Aug 2023)
#### *Summer School Students* (Singapore)
- Enrolled in a computer vision summer course with hands-on project experience in traffic signal recognition systems.
### **SCUT Racing Autonomous Driving Team**(Jun 2023 -- Aug 2023)
#### *Intern Team Member* (Guangzhou, China)
- Basically studied about autonomous driving,had a shallow insight into ROS and Ubuntu OS.
