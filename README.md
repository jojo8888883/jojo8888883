## Experience
### **Shenzhen Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics for Society (AIRS)**(Dec 2024 --  )
#### *Research Assistant* (Shenzhen, China)
- Doing research about dexterous robotic manipulation systems combining teleoperation and deep reinforcement learning, while advancing embodied intelligence (Vision-Language-Action) through multi-modal sensory integration.
- Achieved vision-based teleoperation on Allegro Hand(dexterous hand), developed a Python interface for the ALLEGRO HANDâ€™s ROS API using a customized approach to address unique integration needs.
### **Machine Intelligence and Advanced Adaptation Lab (MIAA) in SCUT**(Sep 2024 --  )
#### *Research Assistant* (Guangzhou, China)
- Reproduced Rekep (github.com/huangwl18/ReKep) in simulator on laptop(Win11 RTX3060laptop).Solved environment management and file management problems, solved package dependency problems and tested prompt generalization (poor).
- Reproduced Rekep in simulator on PC(Ubuntu20.04 RTX2080ti).Solved the incompatibility problem after Isaac sim's update.
- Decoupled the code for generating key points in Rekep from the simulation environment, and deployed sam2 to generate key points for real RGB depth images.
- Investigating papers in the field of embodied intelligence and gain help from many predecessors in this field.
### **Festo AG \& Co. KG**(Jul 2024 -- Sep 2024)
#### *Intern Software Engineer* (Shanghai, China)
- Carried out the Vision grasping project and ABB robot arm safety door lock project.
- During the Vision grasping project, proposed a new approach called Continual Learning, to enhance the flexibility and Memory Efficiency of training process and simplify the operation of the B-end users during the fine-tuning process.
- Worked on the Power App Workflow: Didactic GPrC inquiry project. The understanding of IT infrastructure and workflows enabled me to optimize the project and streamline communication processes across departments.
### **National University of Singapore**(Jul 2023 -- Aug 2023)
#### *Summer Visiting Students* (Singapore)
- Basically studied about Computer Vision and done an Traffic Sign Recognition project through group work.
- Adopted HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) for annotating the dataset and utilized the SVC weight file to train our custom model.
- Implemented Gaussian filtering in the data preprocessing stage, the accuracy increased from 99.3\% to 99.5\%
### **SCUT Racing Autonomous Driving Team**(Jun 2023 -- Aug 2023)
#### *Intern Team Member* (Guangzhou, China)
- Basically studied about the component of autonomous driving cars,had a comprehensive insight into the market and the trendy idea of car production.
- Learned about A*, Q-learning, SLAM, Pure Pursuit, Stanley Method, FSSIM, ROS,which are the base of autonomous driving.
- Built a virtual environment with Linux system and tried numbers of algorithms in the system including A*,Q-learning,SLAM,Pure Pursuit,Stanley Method to improve the decision planning and motion control.
----
## Projects
### **Image Recognition for Fruit-Picking Robots based on Yolov5**(Nov 2023 -- Dec 2023)
####  |Yolov5, Mosaic data enhancement, labelImg, Model training|
- Adopted labelImg to label the data and used Yolov5s weight file to train our own model
- Used Mosaic data enhancement in the input side for data preprocessing, and operations such as random scaling, random cropping and random arrangement were adopted for the data set to improve the complexity of the data set.
